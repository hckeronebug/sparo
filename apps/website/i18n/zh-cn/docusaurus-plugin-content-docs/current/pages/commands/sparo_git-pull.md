title: sparo git-pull
---

This is the [mirrored subcommand](./overview.md) for `git pull`.  It has the same functionality as the corresponding Git subcommand, but supports Sparo's optional anonymous timing metrics collection.

```
sparo git-pull [<options>] [<repository> [<refspec>…​]]
```

See [git pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) in the Git documentation for details.
