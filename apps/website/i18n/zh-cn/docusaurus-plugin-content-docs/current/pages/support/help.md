## Troubleshooting tips

- UPGRADE TO THE LATEST GIT.  Sparo normally reports an error if your Git version is too old.  If the minimum Git version is not high enough, let us know!

- If an operation is failing, use `--debug` to investigate.  For example, `sparo --debug clone http://my-repo` instead of `sparo clone http://my-repo`.
